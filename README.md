# React Native TOEIC App

## Overview

The React Native TOEIC App is a mobile application developed using React Native and Expo. This mobile application helps users practice two key skills of the TOEIC exam: Speaking and Writing.

For the Speaking section, the app utilizes speech-to-text libraries to convert users' audio responses into text, allowing them to check whether their spoken answers meet the requirements.

For the Writing section, the app integrates OpenAI's API to analyze and provide feedback on users' written responses, helping them improve their writing skills.
